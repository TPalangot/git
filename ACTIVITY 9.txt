ACTIVITY 9
Step -1 : use git branch command to see which branch you are in  
> git branch
Step-2 check the log to get hash and commit message using following command  
>git log –oneline 
Step-3: To view the details of a specific commit, including the author, date, and commit message, you can 
use the git show command 
>git show <commit_id> 
Example : >git show 96117fd
Note : if you want to see only author, date and commit message use the following command 
$ git log -n 1 <commit-ID> 
Example : git log -n 1 96117fd 
Note: if you want to see only commit message the use command  
> git log --format=%B -n 1 96117fd

ACTIVITY 10
Step-1 : To list all commits made by the author "JohnDoe" between "2023-01-01" and "2023-12-31," you can use 
the git log command with the --author and –since and –until option 

> git log --author="JohnDoe" --since="2023-01-01" --until="2023-12-31" 
To display the last five commits in the repository's history, you can use the git log command 
with the -n option to limit the number of commits displayed. Here's the command:
> git log -n 5 
Note:- If you want a more condensed view, you can use the --oneline option to display each 
commit on a single line: 
> git log -n 5 –oneline

ACTIVITY 12
To undo the changes introduced by a specific commit with the ID "abc123", you can use the "git 
revert" command. This command creates a new commit that undoes the changes made by the 
specified commit. 
>git revert abc123 
Sometimes It shows message waiting editor to close  

Note : If you want to revert multiple commits, you can specify a range of commits. For example, 
to revert all commits from "abc123" to "def456", you can use: 
> git revert abc123..def456 
Note: Remember that git revert does not remove the original commit from the history; instead, it 
creates a new commit that undoes the changes introduced by the specified commit. If you want 
to completely remove a commit from the history, you can use "git rebase" or "git reset", but these 
commands should be used with caution
