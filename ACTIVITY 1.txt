ACTIVITY 1
Step-2: To check the version of git installed in your computer use below command 
>git - -version  
Step-3 create the folder on any location in your computer  
>mkdir  sri( sri is your folder name) 
Step-4 go inside folder using command 
>cd sri 
Step-5 make the test folder as your local repository using command 
>git init 
Step-6 check status of the git using command 
>git status
Step -7 create a text file "test.txt" 
>echo>test.txt 
Step-8 write something in a text file using command and open it in notepad and check the content. 
>echo "my name is srinath">test.txt

>git status 
Step-10: 
Put your files from working area to staging area using command 
>git add test.txt

To add the file from working directory to local repository use the following command  
>git commit –m "this is my first commit" 



activity 2
Step-1 Create a new branch named "feature-branch" and switch to it using command  
>git checkout -b feature-branch 
Step-2 Make your changes and commit them to the "feature-branch". 
Step-3 To Switch back to the "master" branch use command  
> git checkout master 
Step-3 To Merge the changes from "feature-branch" into "master" use command 
> git merge feature-branch


activity 3
Step-1: Go to the working directory and open the file and see the changes using command 
> notepad test.txt 
step 2 check the status of the command
>git status
> git stash 
Note : after this command it will give random stash name/reference 
(eg:8bebf5a)
Step 4: To get the stash log use command  
> git stash list 
Step 5: to see what is there in the saved stash before applying it back use 
command 
>git stash show  
or to see full detail use command 
>git stash show –p or (>git stash show stash{2} –p) 
Step 6: to apply any particular stash and keep the stash entry as it is 
without deleting it then use command  
> git stash apply (recent stash is applied) 
Or 
>git stash apply stash@{2}
Note:- use command >git stash pop to take recent stash back to file and 
delete the saved stash automatically from stash list.
Note: After applying the stashed changes, you might want to delete the stash 
entry if you no longer need it then use command  
> git stash drop 
Note: if you want to clear entire stash list then use command 
> git stash clear 
Note: if you want to create new branch with a stash then use command  
>git stash branch new_feature stash@{0
